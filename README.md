# mass_woocommerce_import

## created by Fany Siswanto
This script allows mass imports from just a directory and then colors

So the first path is the import directory
the 2nd path is the product name
the 3rd is the color and also the product image

So for example the directory structure like this
* "import_this"/"Some fancy tshirt"/blue.png
* "import_this"/"Some fancy tshirt"/red.png
* "import_this"/"Some fancy tshirt"/green.png
* "import_this"/"Some fancy tshirt"/black.png

It will create product "Some fancy tshirt" with 4 color variations.
